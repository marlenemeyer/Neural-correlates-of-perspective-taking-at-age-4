# Neural-correlates-of-perspective-taking-at-age-4
This EEG data analysis pipeline was written to process EEG data of a study on neural correlates of perspective-taking in 4-year-old children by Marlene Meyer, Natalie Brezack and Amanda L. Woodward. The analysis was geared towards spectral analysis of the theta frequency range. This study was pre-registered here https://osf.io/9gbyh.

Two overarching scripts (MainScript_*_PT_EEG.m) call all other scripts. Individual variables are defined in Individualized_Info_PT_EEG.m.
